# Privacy Policy for Universal Sign Out

Last Updated: January 14, 2025

## Overview

Universal Sign Out ("the Extension") is designed to provide a simple, one-click sign out functionality for web applications. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

The Extension:
- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not track user behavior
- Does not store any user data
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Only interacts with the current active tab to perform the sign out action

## How It Works

The Extension operates by:
1. Only accessing the currently active tab when you click the extension icon
2. Executing a simple script to trigger the sign out action
3. No data is stored or transmitted during this process

## Permissions

The Extension requires minimal permissions:
- `activeTab`: To interact with the current tab when you click the extension
- `scripting`: To execute the sign out script on the current page

These permissions are used solely for the sign out functionality and do not enable any form of tracking or data collection.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
